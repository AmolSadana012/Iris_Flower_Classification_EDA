# Iris Flower Classification

![License: Non-Commercial Use Only](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Non--Commercial-orange)

This project is a machine learning application that classifies iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on their sepal and petal measurements. It leverages supervised learning algorithms and provides predictions through a simple command-line interface.

# Features
- Classifies iris flowers based on sepal and petal length/width.
- Trained on the classic **Iris dataset**.
- Multiple models supported: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.
- Evaluation metrics provided: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization (optional):** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

# Features Used in the Model
- Sepal Length (cm)  
- Sepal Width (cm)  
- Petal Length (cm)  
- Petal Width (cm)  
These features are used to train the classification model to predict one of the three species.

# Model Overview
The project implements the following supervised learning models:
- **Linear Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
Example: KNN achieved the highest accuracy of 100% on the Iris dataset.
  
The data is preprocessed to handle any inconsistencies, and evaluation metrics are computed to assess model performance.
